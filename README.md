Case: Sida 
Team name: VI6 
Team members: Marta Trusohamn, Vlad Dobrovan, Pavlo Lebediev, Tianmin Lyu, Ramon Medeiros, Daniel Hamngren
Description of solution: “The biggest challenge we had is creating a visualization product merging two dimensions of data, corruption index by country and the amount of donation SIDA has given to each country. We used the Javascript React and react simple maps, recharts libraries to build the foundation of our product. We created a heatmap matrix to visualize the quandary between donations in regions with corruption. The data we used from Gothenburg University and OECD was later used to in a simple way visualize the inherent dilemma.” - Marta Trusohamn
